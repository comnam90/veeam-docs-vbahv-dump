# Step 5 Finish Working with Wizard


At the Summary step of the wizard, check that the cluster or Prism Central has been successfully added and click Finish.

| Tip |
| You can review details of the cluster or Prism Central registration session in system logs as described in the Veeam Backup & Replication User Guide, section [Viewing History Statistics](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/vbr/userguide/history_statistics.html?ver=13). |

After you complete the wizard, it is required that you configure at least one worker. You can proceed to the New Nutanix AHV Worker wizard immediately, or launch the wizard later as described in section [Managing Workers](workers.md).
